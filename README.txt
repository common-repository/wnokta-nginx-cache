WNOKTA Nginx Cache Eklentisi

== Description ==

The plugin combines the .css and js files of the pages visited by your site and compresses the html codes into an html file, and then the visited page is statically called and published from the created html file.
The plugin also clears the cache received based on NGINX Server. This feature works only if you have received hosting from WNOKTA and your site is hosted on this hosting.
